What can we even do with wordclouds?

For me, I know that I am interesting in attempting to find my scholar-niche, prepare for publication, and produce my own scholarship. I find creating wordclouds useful as a means of better understanding the field I am attempting to call my own. Throughout my graduate career, I've heard several times that publishing or producing scholarship is about "joining the conversation," but looking at existing, century-long scholarship has been both intimidating and overwhelming.

My wordclouds in partiular help me "see the conversations" happening in Computers and Composition, and I see them as a useful starting place for looking for both common publishing practices and gaps.

Speaking of gaps, analyzing wordclouds could be a very useful method for identifying gaps and "turns" in specific fields.

Some limitations that I found pretty quickly include the inability to upload and analyze large corpora, although I might be able to find a tool that enables that option.

What else might be useful? I suppose we could "follow the rabbit trail" of some of the most surprising, most used, or most outstanding trends to determine choices in scholarship, publishing, or research interest.

We could get crazy and do some creative work, like poems or drawings, because why not?

If you're building a website or app, you have a few key responsibilities to keep in mind.

According to [Google's Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals) guide, your website should be 
* **fast**
* **integrated**
* **reliable** 
* **engaging**
 
Digital Rhetoricians like myself also suggest **useful**, **usable**, **accessible**, and **responsive**. Ideally, your website also **degrades gracefully**.

Sound great! How do you do all those things?

Looking again at [Google's Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell), one basic suggestion is to create a "shell" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This shell should house the basic framework for your site, and can be tested for speed using tools such as the [Lighthouse extension](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse) available on Github.

Speaking of which, get familiar with Github for an open-access community to support, share, and save your code.

Finally, take some time digging in available resources from Google, documentation for the language you are trying to learn, and communities like Overstack and even Reddit to troubleshoot your way through coding projects.

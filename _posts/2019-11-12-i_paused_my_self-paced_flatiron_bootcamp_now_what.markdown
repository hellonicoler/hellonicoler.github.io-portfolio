Hey there, Flatiron family. After a three month hiatus, aka a "pause" on my Flatiron Bootcamp, I am officially "back."

I'll be honest, I didn't have much choice in the matter: my bank account was recently charged, and I can't seem to get in touch with anyone at the school. I'm sure I haven't tried the "right" way, or even "hard enough," but a phone call seems to be a big no-go for me.

So, while I'm working on figuring out how to really get back into things administrateively, I started working on some of my lessons again.

After three months, I expected to be totally lost. Fortunately, that hasn't seemed to be entirely true. Trying to get my account set back up has been tough for some unexpected reasons, namely the collaboration with my GitHub acccount. I am in a graduate school program and our class has been using GitHub; I didn't quite realize how Flatiron really bolted itself onto my account. I removed them in order to work on my class GitHub project as expected, but couldn't seem to get Flatiron projects going without refreshing my access.

Fortunately, the IDE in browswer seems unaffected. I had been using my own setup, but I figure it's "easier" to just not mess with it for now.

I'm trying to wrap up various loose ends, such as this "overdue" blog. I had a drafted blog up already, which I'll share here to give you an idea of where my mindset was before pausing the Flatiron program:

> I have fallen off the coding bangwagon. I recently wrote a blog post describing how to get back on track. But you know what? I haven't yet. 
> 
> I started a new full-time job, which should be reason to celebrate. 
> 
> But the unexpected job offer has derailed my coding plans. I have now gone about one full month without coding, and trying to get back into the swing of things has been harder than I expected. I don't want to give up, but trying to fit in coding with my full-time job, graduate school, and being a mom
> 

That's it, that's all I wrote. And then I paused the program. I've now been at my job for a little over four months, I'm set to graduate this semester (just over 30 days!), and my toddler is working on potty training.

What does all of this have to do with coding? Well, life just keeps moving. I guess I'm not really sure what I'm doing anymore, but hopefully we'll figure out. I still think there's plenty of benefit to learning to code, and I have several projects that I would love to work on when I develop my skills enough.

So, I guess what I'm saying is, just keep coding.
